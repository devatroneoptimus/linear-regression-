##  Introduction-
### Linear regression is a popular technique in statistics and machine learning for modeling the relationship between variables. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points, minimizing the distance between the line and the data points. This repository provides a basic implementation of linear regression using Python's standard libraries.
## Cost function
### The cost function, also known as the loss function or objective function, measures the error or discrepancy between the predicted outputs of a machine learning model and the actual target values in the training dataset.
## Gradient Descent
### Gradient descent is a popular optimization technique used to update the model's parameters iteratively and minimize the cost function. It calculates the gradient (derivative) of the cost function with respect to the model's parameters and adjusts them in the opposite direction of the gradient to find the minimum.
## Overfitting and Underfitting
### The choice of the cost function can affect the model's behavior and the risk of overfitting or underfitting the data. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Underfitting happens when the model's performance is poor on both training and test data.

## Regularization
### To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can be added to the cost function. These techniques penalize large model parameters and encourage simpler models.
